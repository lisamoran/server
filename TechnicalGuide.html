<h2>1. Location-Based Quiz App Technical Guide</h2>

<p>The Location-Based Quiz App has three components: a Quiz App, a Question App and a server. Together they create a quiz for Bloomsbury and around UCL campus, involving the setting of questions and a quiz giving questions to answer as the user walks around. </p> 


<h3>1.1 The Questions App Component</h3>

<p>The Questions App enables the user to create questions for use in the Quiz App. It contains a Leaflet map which the user can click on to find the latitude and logitude of a selected question location. It also contains a form held in a side panel which the user can complete to create a new question with answer options.</p>
<p>The Questions App has an associated 'appActivity.js' file which runs such functions as: loading the Leaflet map and creating a popup displaying the point's latitude and longitude on map click.</p>
<p>The Questions App also has an associated 'uploadData.js' which uploads the question as part of a XMLHttp Request which the server processes.</p>
<p>The code for the Questions App can be found at:</p>

<h3>1.2 The Quiz App Component</h3>

<p>The Quiz App contains a Leaflet map on which the user can display the question points by clicking a 'Get Question Points' button.</p> 
<p>The Quiz App has a function to track the user's location and add it to the Leaflet map, by clicking the 'Track User Location' button.</p>
<p>The Quiz App has an associated 'appActivity.js' file which runs the track location function, the map loading function, and also the XMLHttp Request to load the question points as a GeoJSON layer.</p>

<h3>1.3 The Server Component</h3>

<p>The Server is a nodejs based server. It connects with a PostGresSQL/PostGIS database to store and serve the questions data.</p>
<p>The httpServer.js uses POST requests to upload questions created in the Questions App, using SQL INSERT statements. It also contains a getQuestions function to retrieve the questions points from the database using a SELECT QUERY and send then to the Quiz App.</p>
